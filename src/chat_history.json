The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, was a tragic event in Indian history. It took place on **April 13, 1919**, in **Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, India**.\n\nHere's a summary of what I know:\n\n*   **Context:** The massacre occurred during a period of unrest in India against British rule. The Rowlatt Act, which allowed the British government to imprison anyone suspected of sedition without a trial, had sparked widespread protests.\n\n*   **The Gathering:** On Baisakhi (a Sikh festival), a large crowd of unarmed people gathered in Jallianwala Bagh. They were protesting the arrest of two popular Indian leaders, Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satya Pal, and discussing the Rowlatt Act.\n\n*   **The Massacre:** Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, without warning, ordered his troops to open fire on the unarmed crowd. The troops fired for about 10 minutes, aiming at the densest parts of the crowd. The only exit was blocked, trapping many people inside.\n\n*   **Casualties:** The official British estimate was 379 deaths and over 1,200 injured. However, Indian sources claim that the actual number of deaths was much higher, potentially exceeding 1,000.\n\n*   **Aftermath:** The massacre sparked outrage across India and further fueled the Indian independence movement. It is considered a turning point in the relationship between India and British rule. It led to increased support for Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent movement and strengthened the resolve for independence.\n\n*   **Reginald Dyer:** Dyer was widely condemned in India and, to a lesser extent, in Britain. While some Britons considered him a hero for preventing a potential rebellion, he was eventually relieved of his command.\n\nThe Jallianwala Bagh massacre remains a symbol of British colonial oppression and a significant event in the history of the Indian independence movement.\n"}]
